<p>And Jesus said to him, "Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head."</p>
<p>But that you may know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins"--then He said to the paralytic, "Arise, take up your bed, and go to your house."</p>
<p>When they persecute you in this city, flee to another. For assuredly, I say to you, you will not have gone through the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes.</p>
<p>The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, "Look, a glutton and a winebibber, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!' But wisdom is justified by her children."</p>
<p>For the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath."</p>
<p>Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him, either in this age or in the age to come.</p>
<p>For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.</p>
<p>He answered and said to them: "He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man.</p>
<p>The Son of Man will send out His angels, and they will gather out of His kingdom all things that offend, and those who practice lawlessness,</p>
<p>When Jesus came into the region of Caesarea Philippi, He asked His disciples, saying, "Who do men say that I, the Son of Man, am?"</p>
<p>For the Son of Man will come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and then He will reward each according to his works.</p>
<p>Assuredly, I say to you, there are some standing here who shall not taste death till they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom."</p>
<p>Now as they came down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, "Tell the vision to no one until the Son of Man is risen from the dead."</p>
<p>But I say to you that Elijah has come already, and they did not know him but did to him whatever they wished. Likewise the Son of Man is also about to suffer at their hands."</p>
<p>Now while they were staying in Galilee, Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men,</p>
<p>For the Son of Man has come to save that which was lost.</p>
<p>So Jesus said to them, "Assuredly I say to you, that in the regeneration, when the Son of Man sits on the throne of His glory, you who have followed Me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</p>
<p>"Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and to the scribes; and they will condemn Him to death,</p>
<p>just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many."</p>
<p>For as the lightning comes from the east and flashes to the west, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be.</p>
<p>Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.</p>
<p>But as the days of Noah were, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be.</p>
<p>and did not know until the flood came and took them all away, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be.</p>
<p>Therefore you also be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.</p>
<p>"Watch therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour in which the Son of Man is coming.</p>
<p>"When the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the holy angels with Him, then He will sit on the throne of His glory.</p>
<p>"You know that after two days is the Passover, and the Son of Man will be delivered up to be crucified."</p>
<p>The Son of Man indeed goes just as it is written of Him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been good for that man if he had not been born."</p>
<p>Then He came to His disciples and said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners.</p>
<p>Jesus said to him, "It is as you said. Nevertheless, I say to you, hereafter you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power, and coming on the clouds of heaven."</p>
<p>But that you may know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins"--He said to the paralytic,</p>
<p>Therefore the Son of Man is also Lord of the Sabbath."</p>
<p>And He began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.</p>
<p>For whoever is ashamed of Me and My words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him the Son of Man also will be ashamed when He comes in the glory of His Father with the holy angels."</p>
<p>Now as they came down from the mountain, He commanded them that they should tell no one the things they had seen, till the Son of Man had risen from the dead.</p>
<p>Then He answered and told them, "Indeed, Elijah is coming first and restores all things. And how is it written concerning the Son of Man, that He must suffer many things and be treated with contempt?</p>
<p>For He taught His disciples and said to them, "The Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of men, and they will kill Him. And after He is killed, He will rise the third day."</p>
<p>"Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and to the scribes; and they will condemn Him to death and deliver Him to the Gentiles;</p>
<p>For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many."</p>
<p>Then they will see the Son of Man coming in the clouds with great power and glory.</p>
<p>The Son of Man indeed goes just as it is written of Him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been good for that man if he had never been born."</p>
<p>Then He came the third time and said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? It is enough! The hour has come; behold, the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners.</p>
<p>Jesus said, "I am. And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power, and coming with the clouds of heaven."</p>
<p>But that you may know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins"--He said to the man who was paralyzed, "I say to you, arise, take up your bed, and go to your house."</p>
<p>And He said to them, "The Son of Man is also Lord of the Sabbath."</p>
<p>Blessed are you when men hate you, And when they exclude you, And revile you, and cast out your name as evil, For the Son of Man's sake.</p>
<p>The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, "Look, a glutton and a winebibber, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!'</p>
<p>saying, "The Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised the third day."</p>
<p>For whoever is ashamed of Me and My words, of him the Son of Man will be ashamed when He comes in His own glory, and in His Father's, and of the holy angels.</p>
<p>"Let these words sink down into your ears, for the Son of Man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men."</p>
<p>For the Son of Man did not come to destroy men's lives but to save them." And they went to another village.</p>
<p>And Jesus said to him, "Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head."</p>
<p>For as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so also the Son of Man will be to this generation.</p>
<p>"Also I say to you, whoever confesses Me before men, him the Son of Man also will confess before the angels of God.</p>
<p>"And anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him; but to him who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven.</p>
<p>Therefore you also be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect."</p>
<p>Then He said to the disciples, "The days will come when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man, and you will not see it.</p>
<p>For as the lightning that flashes out of one part under heaven shines to the other part under heaven, so also the Son of Man will be in His day.</p>
<p>And as it was in the days of Noah, so it will be also in the days of the Son of Man:</p>
<p>Even so will it be in the day when the Son of Man is revealed.</p>
<p>I tell you that He will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will He really find faith on the earth?"</p>
<p>Then He took the twelve aside and said to them, "Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of Man will be accomplished.</p>
<p>for the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which was lost."</p>
<p>Then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.</p>
<p>Watch therefore, and pray always that you may be counted worthy to escape all these things that will come to pass, and to stand before the Son of Man."</p>
<p>And truly the Son of Man goes as it has been determined, but woe to that man by whom He is betrayed!"</p>
<p>But Jesus said to him, "Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?"</p>
<p>Hereafter the Son of Man will sit on the right hand of the power of God."</p>
<p>saying, "The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again."'</p>
<p>And He said to him, "Most assuredly, I say to you, hereafter you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man."</p>
<p>No one has ascended to heaven but He who came down from heaven, that is, the Son of Man who is in heaven.</p>
<p>And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up,</p>
<p>and has given Him authority to execute judgment also, because He is the Son of Man.</p>
<p>Do not labor for the food which perishes, but for the food which endures to everlasting life, which the Son of Man will give you, because God the Father has set His seal on Him."</p>
<p>Then Jesus said to them, "Most assuredly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you have no life in you.</p>
<p>What then if you should see the Son of Man ascend where He was before?</p>
<p>Then Jesus said to them, "When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am He, and that I do nothing of Myself; but as My Father taught Me, I speak these things.</p>
<p>But Jesus answered them, saying, "The hour has come that the Son of Man should be glorified.</p>
<p>The people answered Him, "We have heard from the law that the Christ remains forever; and how can You say, "The Son of Man must be lifted up'? Who is this Son of Man?"</p>
<p>So, when he had gone out, Jesus said, "Now the Son of Man is glorified, and God is glorified in Him.</p>
<p>and said, "Look! I see the heavens opened and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God!"</p>
<p>But one testified in a certain place, saying: "What is man that You are mindful of him, Or the son of man that You take care of him?</p>
<p>and in the midst of the seven lampstands One like the Son of Man, clothed with a garment down to the feet and girded about the chest with a golden band.</p>
<p>Then I looked, and behold, a white cloud, and on the cloud sat One like the Son of Man, having on His head a golden crown, and in His hand a sharp sickle.</p>
<p>Now when the tempter came to Him, he said, "If You are the Son of God, command that these stones become bread."</p>
<p>and said to Him, "If You are the Son of God, throw Yourself down. For it is written: "He shall give His angels charge over you,' and, "In their hands they shall bear you up, Lest you dash your foot against a stone."'</p>
<p>And suddenly they cried out, saying, "What have we to do with You, Jesus, You Son of God? Have You come here to torment us before the time?"</p>
<p>Then those who were in the boat came and worshiped Him, saying, "Truly You are the Son of God."</p>
<p>But Jesus kept silent. And the high priest answered and said to Him, "I put You under oath by the living God: Tell us if You are the Christ, the Son of God!"</p>
<p>and saying, "You who destroy the temple and build it in three days, save Yourself! If You are the Son of God, come down from the cross."</p>
<p>He trusted in God; let Him deliver Him now if He will have Him; for He said, "I am the Son of God."'</p>
<p>So when the centurion and those with him, who were guarding Jesus, saw the earthquake and the things that had happened, they feared greatly, saying, "Truly this was the Son of God!"</p>
<p>The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.</p>
<p>And the unclean spirits, whenever they saw Him, fell down before Him and cried out, saying, "You are the Son of God."</p>
<p>So when the centurion, who stood opposite Him, saw that He cried out like this and breathed His last, he said, "Truly this Man was the Son of God!"</p>
<p>And the angel answered and said to her, "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Highest will overshadow you; therefore, also, that Holy One who is to be born will be called the Son of God.</p>
<p>the son of Enosh, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God.</p>
<p>And the devil said to Him, "If You are the Son of God, command this stone to become bread."</p>
<p>Then he brought Him to Jerusalem, set Him on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to Him, "If You are the Son of God, throw Yourself down from here.</p>
<p>And demons also came out of many, crying out and saying, "You are the Christ, the Son of God!" And He, rebuking them, did not allow them to speak, for they knew that He was the Christ.</p>
<p>Then they all said, "Are You then the Son of God?" So He said to them, "You rightly say that I am."</p>
<p>And I have seen and testified that this is the Son of God."</p>
<p>Nathanael answered and said to Him, "Rabbi, You are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!"</p>
<p>"He who believes in Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</p>
<p>Most assuredly, I say to you, the hour is coming, and now is, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God; and those who hear will live.</p>
<p>Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when He had found him, He said to him, "Do you believe in the Son of God?"</p>
<p>do you say of Him whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, "You are blaspheming,' because I said, "I am the Son of God'?</p>
<p>When Jesus heard that, He said, "This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified through it."</p>
<p>She said to Him, "Yes, Lord, I believe that You are the Christ, the Son of God, who is to come into the world."</p>
<p>The Jews answered him, "We have a law, and according to our law He ought to die, because He made Himself the Son of God."</p>
<p>but these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in His name.</p>
<p>Then Philip said, "If you believe with all your heart, you may." And he answered and said, "I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God."</p>
<p>Immediately he preached the Christ in the synagogues, that He is the Son of God.</p>
<p>and declared to be the Son of God with power according to the Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead.</p>
<p>For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us--by me, Silvanus, and Timothy--was not Yes and No, but in Him was Yes.</p>
<p>I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me.</p>
<p>till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ;</p>
<p>Seeing then that we have a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession.</p>
<p>if they fall away, to renew them again to repentance, since they crucify again for themselves the Son of God, and put Him to an open shame.</p>
<p>without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of God, remains a priest continually.</p>
<p>Of how much worse punishment, do you suppose, will he be thought worthy who has trampled the Son of God underfoot, counted the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified a common thing, and insulted the Spirit of grace?</p>
<p>He who sins is of the devil, for the devil has sinned from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that He might destroy the works of the devil.</p>
<p>Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God.</p>
<p>Who is he who overcomes the world, but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?</p>
<p>He who believes in the Son of God has the witness in himself; he who does not believe God has made Him a liar, because he has not believed the testimony that God has given of His Son.</p>
<p>He who has the Son has life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have life.</p>
<p>These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life, and that you may continue to believe in the name of the Son of God.</p>
<p>And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us an understanding, that we may know Him who is true; and we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life.</p>
<p>"And to the angel of the church in Thyatira write, "These things says the Son of God, who has eyes like a flame of fire, and His feet like fine brass:</p>
